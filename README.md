Meta Database Engineering Capstone

In this course I completed a capstone project in which I created a database and client for Little Lemon restaurant. 

The Capstone project enabled me to demonstrate multiple skills from the Certificate by solving an authentic real-world problem. in this case, it was to design Little Lemon's database and access the data via the Python MySQL Connector API.

I demonstrate my new skillset by designing and composing a database solution, combining all the skills and technologies I've learned throughout the program to solve the problem at hand. 

By the end of this project, I had proven your ability to:
-Set up a database project, - Database Modelling, Forward and Backward Engineering, Model Synchronization
-Add sales reports,
-Create a table booking system,
-Work with data analytics and visualization, - Tableau, Data Modelling (Snowflake)
-And create a database client. - via Python MySQL Connector API

I also demonstrated my ability with the following tools and software:
-Git,
-MySQL Workbench,
-Tableau,
-And Python.
